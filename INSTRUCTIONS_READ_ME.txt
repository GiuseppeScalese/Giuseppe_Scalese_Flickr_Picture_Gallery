Run the index.html file and check the test out.

This test has been implemented on Google Chrome and Firefox. It is also responsive.

This test will work on IE browsers only if it is loaded on a server. The Local storage functionality doensn't work in Internet Explorer when using the "file://" protocol. It works once the project is loaded on a server. I've added comments in the code which explains the reason why it doensn't work in any IE browsers.
